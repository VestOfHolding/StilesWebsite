The year is 2019. World War III has ended with all of humanity on the losing side against a completely unexpected enemy: Vampires. Vampire society have chosen to escape the shadows to take control of most of the world, leaving only a handful of desperate human enclaves left. Research into human cloning is perfected to create a consistent source of blood, while the humans in Neo-Tokyo try to cultivate psychic powers. The former US tried to fight back by creating human-like robots that the vampires couldn't feed on, but with the war now over, vampiric propoganda combined with simple human paranoia of being replaced by yet another species that looks like them, the idea of creating more synthetic humans that might live among them is seen with complex emotions at best, and outright hatred at worst. Los Angeles ends up becoming the center of both replicant hunting and an extravagent, sadistic game show that features humans hunting and killing each other for the audience's entertainment.

By 2022, humans regained control of the planet and the USA begins to reform. However, they find themselves in charge of an extremely aggressive population forged by fear and war, and too small of a police force to control them. One of the solutions they come up with is the yearly Purge, one day out of the year where nothing is illegal and mob justice rules.

After humanity made first contact with the Vulcans the previous century, they continue trying to develop faster-than-light travel through their warp drives. While this technology is being developed, capitalism isn't dead and companies such as Weyland-Yutani send employees and mercenaries out on long voyages into space, thanks to advances in cryogenics, in order to investigate other alien civilizations and technologies that they can profit from. This often comes at the expense of those employees and mercenaries.

Unknown to Captain Jonathan Archer when he takes command of the first warp five capable ship in 2151, humanity has already had multiple fatal encounters with the horrifying xenomorphs.
