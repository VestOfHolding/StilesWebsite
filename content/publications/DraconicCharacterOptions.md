Walking the path of the dragon can grant you immense power, but true dragons come in many shapes and dispositions, so choose carefully. Some may ask for a cost you cannot pay, or don’t understand. Some may offer you sage advice on how to move forward, while yet others will obliterate you on the spot.

Within this supplement, you will find many new dragon-themed player options, and expanded existing options to encompass choosing options to reflect all types of true dragons. This covers all 7 categories and 39 types of true dragon!
